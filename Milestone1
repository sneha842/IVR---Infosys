# Milestone 1 — Airline IVR Modernization (Concise)

## 1. Objective
Assess legacy **VXML-based IVR** used in airline customer support and define requirements to integrate with **modern IVR**, **ACS (cloud communication services)**, and **BAP (automation platform)**.

---
## 2. Current Legacy System (Summary)
- VXML menus for: flight status, booking, baggage, refunds.
- Components:
  - Telephony gateway
  - VXML server
  - ASR/TTS engine
  - Media server
  - CTI routing
  - Backend SOAP connections to PSS/PNR
- Limitations:
  - Rigid DTMF menus
  - Poor ASR accuracy
  - Slow backend response
  - No personalization / context

---
## 3. Airline Use-Case (Selected): Flight Status Enquiry
**Flow:**
1. Caller chooses language
2. Caller inputs PNR or Flight Number
3. IVR fetches live data from PSS
4. System announces flight status
5. Offers SMS update or agent transfer

---
## 4. Integration Requirements (ACS + BAP)
### Functional
- Real-time flight/PNR lookups
- Cloud ASR/TTS
- Multi-language IVR
- Context-aware agent transfer
- SMS/email alerts via BAP

### Technical
- SIP → ACS migration
- Modern IVR built with ACS call automation
- BAP orchestration for PSS + CRM APIs
- Unified session storage
- Secure REST API gateway

---
## 5. Technical Challenges & Gaps
- DTMF failures on SIP migration
- Legacy SOAP backend from PSS
- Low ASR accuracy in VXML grammars
- No session continuity
- Compliance concerns (PII/Payments)
- Weak monitoring & logging

**Mitigation:** Cloud ASR, REST API wrappers, centralized logs, proper DTMF tuning, tokenized payments.

---
## 6. Modernization Roadmap
1. Document existing VXML flows
2. Build API façade in BAP (PSS + CRM)
3. Move SIP workloads to ACS
4. Rebuild priority flows (start with Flight Status)
5. Add omnichannel notifications and automation

---
## 7. Deliverables (Milestone 1)
- Legacy IVR assessment
- Flight Status use-case mapping
- Gap analysis
- ACS + BAP integration requirements
- Modernization roadmap
